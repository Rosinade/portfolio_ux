        <h2>Time to change the mobile shopping experience </h2>
        <br>
          <p>What do you think of when I say the word “shopping”?<br>
            <br>In life, there are 2 kinds of people. There are those who love shopping, it’s a fun time with friends. And there are those for whom shopping is a nightmare.
              Whether you are in one case or another, today we are all confined and shopping with friends can be forgotten.</br>
            <br>But shopping remains available and has increased since then. We may have found a solution to make shopping more enjoyable.</p>

          <h5>To start</h5>
            <p>During this project, we had to analyze the already existing and highly adopted Amazon app and <b>integrate a new feature into the existing product.</b> 
              On the first time, we did some research concerning the <b>users</b> of the brand and its <b>competitors</b> according to the new feature that we want to add. 
              Also, we want to know the habits that our users have with this app and whether they will be ready to use the new feature.</p>

            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p>Amazon is the second-largest online clothing and shoe supplier with 4.8% share of the online market.
            <br>Key players such as Asos and Boohoo are often ahead of the curve in terms of introducing new features such as “buy now, pay later” 
            but Amazon wants to <b>focus on customers, not competitors.</b></p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-bodyshape.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </figure>

            <h5>BodyShape</h5>
            <p>We have chosen to create functionality: <b>BodyShape</b>, allowing us to shop and to try the clothes directly from home with the camera. 
              It’s pretty cool especially for this period of confinement.<br>

              <h5>Interviews</h5>
              <p>We interviewed different people who had used Amazon before finding what they were looking for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>They mostly buy <b>books</b> or other <b>simple things</b>.</li>
              <li><b>65% don’t like to buy clothes online</b>, they want to see if the clothes fit on them.</li>
              <li>They buy on Amazon for <b>competitive and cheap prices</b></li>
              <li>They are looking for <b>everyday basics and the efficiency and speed of delivery</b></li>
            </ul>

          <p>And then we introduced them to our new feature, BodyShape:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>All of them told that it would be great and <b>want to try it just by curiosity</b></li>
              <li>They would like to try if it’s <b>easy to use and perfectly done</b></li>
              <li>They would like to have a <b>real demonstration video</b> to get a better view of the clothes, 
                what they look like and thus better see the material of the fabric</li>
            </ul>

          <p>One of our interviewee said:</p></br>

          <p class="quote text-center text-muted font-italic"cite="Verbatim">"It would be cool if it can take my measurements directly, So I don’t have to choose my size and I will not make a mistake"</p>

          <p>To dig deeper into our research, we analyzed the <b>habits of mobile users</b> in general and we noticed that:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A lot of people <b>add the items to the cart just for fun but don’t really buy</b></li>
              <li>Mobile users are <b>not patient</b>, they want to reduce clicks and privilege <b>scroll and swipe</b></li>
              <li>Mobile users <b>spend ⅓ of time waiting</b> for the product page to load</li>
              <li>They spend <b>26 seconds on the app on average & 12 seconds per product on the product page</b></li>
              <li>In general, users prefer to <b>buy their clothes on the desktop</b> and not on mobile</li>
            </ul>
            <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Source: Contentsquare</figcaption>
          
          <p class="quote" cite='verbatim'>"Customers obssessed"</p>
          
            <h5>Ideation session</h5>
            <p>To better meet the needs of users we used the <b>Crazy 8’s method</b>. 
              The idea is that all the participants draw a crazy solution into 8 sessions in one minute and we vote to keep the best.
            </p>
          </br><p>And then, we prioritized those ideas in a diagram with the <b>Moscow method.</b></p><br>

            <figure>
              <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-moscow.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">MoSCoW Method</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Must-Have:</b> See clothes directly in the body with the reality augmented; It will be our main feature for the project.</li>
              <li><b>Should Have:</b> Scan the body & create a 3D avatar; we want to keep those ideas and develop them later</li>
              <li><b>Could Have:</b> Personal shopper online; It can be nice to have this feature, maybe like a real chat with a real person</li>
              <li><b>Won’t Have:</b> Package with different sizes, Amazon’s guy; those features already exist so we will not keep them</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So, we will focus on the feature to <b>try the clothes directly on the body</b>, our Must Have.</p>

            <h5>What does the functionality do exactly?</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Propose to <b>navigate to the “list” page</b> rather than the product page by scrolling and swiping.</li>
              <li><b>Change sizes and colors</b> easily & quickly thanks to the feature.</li>
              <li><b>Add to cart & to a wishlist directly</b> on the feature page, so the user can go back to the items later and continue his shopping.</li>
              <li>This feature will, therefore, be mainly a <b>decision-making help or a source of inspiration</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Wireflow and User flow</h5>
            <p>You can see below the <b>wireflow</b> of different clothing search options on Amazon until added to cart:</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-wireflow.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </figure>

            <p>But let's focus on this <b>userflow</b>: Amazon created an option <b>"StyleSnap"</b> on his app that allows user to looking for an outfit or items thanks to his camera.
              So here, the user wants to find his pink pullover from the <b>StyleSnap</b> option. Thanks to the new feature <b>Bodyshape</b>, he discovers other models, sizes and colors and
              finally switch into a red pullover, changes the size and add it to his cart.<br>

              <figure>
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-userflow.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

              <h5>Time to sketching</h5>
                <p>From this userflow we started to <b>sketch our ideas </b>by focusing on how we could integrate the option in a smart way. <br>
                </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-sketching.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

              <p>At first, we thought of adding the new button at the bottom of the page, either on the bottom right corner or a sticky button but it was really not practical. (draws on the right).<br>
              <br>Finally, we decided to <b>add the future on each picture</b>, only where the user can try the clothes directly.</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-sketching2.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>
            </br>
         
              <p>Before going further in integrating the new functionality, we needed to remember <b>Amazon’s design system & atomic design.</b></p>

              <h5>Design System & Atomic Design</h5>

              <p>A design system is a <b>repository of UX principles, UI components and code snippets.</b><br>
              <br>Companies produce more products faster. Many stakeholders are involved in the design and development phases of these products. 
              And the more people there are, the more complex it is <b>to centralize information and unify UX, UI, and front-end.</b><br>
              <br>At Amazon, despite the fact that the website or the app seems simple, it is in fact much more complex than we think. 
              <b>Every details and color nuances are important.</b></p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-styletile1.jpg"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>


              <h5>From Low-fi to Hi-fi prototype</h5>

              <p class="quote" cite='verbatim'>"A good design is a design that cannot be seen"</p></br>

              <p>As mentioned above, we have discreetly added the new functionality button to each photo.</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-newfeature.png"class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

              <p>Please discover the flow on the video below to see how the BodyShape works</p></br>

              <video class="video" controls width="100%" height="auto">
                <source src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-newfeature.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <source src="video/demo.webm" type="video/webm">
                    <div style="border: 1px solid black ; padding: 8px ;">
                      Sorry, your browser does not support the &lt;video&gt; tag used in this demo.
                    </div>
                </video>

              <p>We have to develop the animation of our carousel and how the user can change & try easily the clothes. We can imagine an animation like on the gif below:</p>

              <figure><div style="text-align: center">
                
                <img src="../ressources/amazon/amazon-animation.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </div>
              </figure>

              <h5>Usability testing</h5>
                <p>We conducted 4 usability testing and had interesting feedback.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>“try with avatar” and “change measurements” are too big so it makes me confused, I don’t know what it is…”</li>
                <li>“The button to add to the cart is not clear”</li>
                <li>“The new feature is too small, I want it bigger”</li>
                <li>“On the Page “picture”, the cross button is too scary…I’m afraid to lose my article if I close it”</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Never too late to iterate</h5>
                <p>For the next steps:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>We decided to remove on the page “try with avatar” and “change my measurements”, it’s not enough to clear and because the errors messages scare away mobile users.</li>
                <li>Change the button add to cart</li>
                <li>Improve the navigation of the feature</li>
              </ul>

            
              <h5>Key learnings</h5>
                <ul>
              <li>During this case, we discovered that The <b>Amazon Design System is much more complex</b> than we think, compared to what we can see on their website which seems simple and not very design.</li>
              <li><b>The choice of clothing size on Amazon</b> is really a pain point and needs to be improved.</li>
              <li>Few people buy on phone little stuffs but prefer to <b>buy clothes on the website desktop.</b></li>
                </ul>

              <h5>Key metrics</h5>
                <ul>
              <li>We will know that our feature will work if the <b>time spent on the app and the “list” page increases.</b></li>
              <li>If the engagement rate increases and consumers validate their cart and if we will get <b>good reviews.</b></li>
                </ul>

              <h5>To go further</h5>
            
              <p>We want to:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Develop the <b>avatar 3D scan</b></li>
                <li>Detect <b>user measurements</b> by using scan</li>
                <li>And promote Amazon fashion through the <b>“Amazon Fashion stories”</b> thanks to a share button to social media for example</li>
              </ul>
